A girl has spent years of her life working hard towards her promotion. Then she actually receives it, but along with the promotion she learns new secrets about the space life that she never wanted to discover. After more study, she is told she needs to go into the other portal, but no one's ever come back from it. She is not sure what to expect, but once she arrives on the other side, she finds that the world is simpler. The rules are fairer and the world is moving well. However, she knows her talents would better serve the other, more corrupt world, but has no way to get back to it. Using a team of random farmers, teachers, etc, she finds a way back to her world so that she could bring this same beauty to it.
